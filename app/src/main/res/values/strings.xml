    <string name="nm_info">Noise Masking is when a camera takes lots of dark pictures to figure out what the average random noise per picture is, and it subtracts that from the original dark image to get a better picture since the darker a picture is, the more random noise there will naturally be. It helps eliminate all this random noise. Note: this is only meant to be used on dark images, not colorful/bright images. The images have also been cropped closely to the center to enhance pixel visibility.</string>
