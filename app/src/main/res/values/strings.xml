    <string name="hdr_proposal">This will be our third of three activities. This activity will be where users can experiment with High Dynamic Range (HDR) Image processing. HDR imaging takes three copies of a photo, each at a different exposure or light level, and it superimposes them on top of each other to reduce the contrast and make the image look more natural. There will be a button in the top left that can bring you back to the launch page. The underlying code will use light sensors and the camera to determine what levels of exposure to take the picture at.</string>

    <string name="launch_desc">This is going to be our launcher page, and our first of three activities. This will be where users start when they open the app. It will look nice and professional, and users will be able to select one of two image processing activities. Depending on which one they select, they will be sent to one of two activities. This page will have some explaining text on it, the buttons will be labeled, and the code for this page/activity will handle switching back and forth between activities.</string>
